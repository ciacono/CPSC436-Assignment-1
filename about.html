    <h2>Message List, the Project</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Message List is a poor man's version of Twitter, used for Assignment 1
        of CPSC 436I as an intro project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        As you hopefully can see, the website has a list of messages,
        to which you can add to yourself. You can also clear the list of
        messages, but new messages added by you are not saved when you
        exit the page. Messages can be 140 characters or less.

    <h2>Claire, the Creator</h2>

      <p>
        Not quite as cool as Tyler, the Creator,
        I am a Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) student at UBC taking
        CPSC 436I, an industry skills course where I hope to learn a lot about
        modern web development. I have some basic previous knowledge of
        HTML/CSS, but this is my first assignment doing something cool all
        on my own. Hope you enjoy!
