    <h2>Message List, the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Message List is a poor man's version of Twitter, used for Assignment 1
        of CPSC 436I as an intro project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        As you hopefully can see, the website has a list of messages, to which you
        can add to yourself. You can also clear the list of messages,
        but new messages added by you are not saved when you exit the page.

    <h2>Claire, the Creator</h2>
      <p>
        Not quite as cool as Tyler, the Creator,
        I am a Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) student at UBC taking CPSC 436I,
        an industry skills course where I hope to learn a lot about
        modern web development.
        I have some basic previous knowledge of HTML/CSS,
        but this is my first assignment doing something cool all on my own.
        Hope you enjoy!
